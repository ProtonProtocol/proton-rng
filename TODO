Replace get_self() with actual ram payer
- Remove  eosio::check from transfer.cpp

- Fix error_cb in stack, should be throw_error, ctx will likely need reference to processor or something

- intx::to_string and intx::hex dont seem safe, especially with gas_left

CONTEXT GAS LEFT IS GOING INTO NEGATIVES!!!

execute_create and execute_call don't currently revert properly
